## Description  
This project aims to develop a distributed quality control system for printed materials using computer vision techniques. The system is based on microcontrollers (Arduino) with camera modules that capture real-time images of printed rolls. These images are analyzed to detect defects such as missing colors or inconsistencies in the print. A central server manages reference designs, processes detected errors, and issues alerts when necessary.
